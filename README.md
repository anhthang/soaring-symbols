# Soaring Symbols

This project aims to create a meticulously curated collection of airline logos and icons entirely in SVG format, serving as a valuable resource for travelers, aviation enthusiasts, and designers.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project, "Soaring Symbols", provides a collection of airline logos/icons in SVG format for informational and reference purposes only. While every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of the logos and information presented, we do not claim ownership of any trademarks or copyrighted materials. The logos remain the intellectual property of their respective airlines.

### Project Scope

The initial phase will focus on building a core collection of high-quality SVG logos from major airlines. The collection will be expanded progressively to include regional and potentially historical airlines.

The inclusion of monochrome versions will depend on the airline's brand guidelines and the feasibility of converting their original logos to a simple, one-color format.

### Contributions

Contributions to the project are welcome, whether through adding new logos, improving existing ones, or suggesting features to enhance usability. Please refer to our [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/anhthang/soaring-symbols/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed instructions on how to contribute effectively.
